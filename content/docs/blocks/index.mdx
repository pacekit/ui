description: Production-ready UI blocks designed for developers and optimized for real apps.
---

A collection of high-performance React blocks crafted for immediate use in real-world applications.
Built with a focus on animation, accessibility, and **AI Readiness**, these components provide the semantic structure necessary for modern LLM-driven interfaces.

## Key Features

### Real-App Blocks

Stop building from scratch. Access a set of sophisticated blocks—from complex headers to interactive data visualizations—designed to be dropped directly into production environments.

### AI-Ready Architecture

Our blocks include optimized metadata and semantic structures that provide layout information for **AI Agents**. This makes it easier for LLMs to understand, manipulate, and generate content within your app's design system.
